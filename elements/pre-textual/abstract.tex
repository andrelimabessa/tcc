JavaScript is the only programming language natively supported by browsers, being
criticized, among other reasons for being extremely dynamic, which made it become the
target of compilation for several other languages. A project that has been highlighted
mainly by its execution performance, and that will be approached in this work, is the
WebAssembly, which also has native support in modern browsers, and that has the
participation of the main browsers providers until then. The purpose of this monograph is
to present a quantitative comparative performance analysis between WebAssembly and
JavaScript, based on its execution times to identify in which cases, codes written in
WebAssembly perform better than codes written in JavaScript.
